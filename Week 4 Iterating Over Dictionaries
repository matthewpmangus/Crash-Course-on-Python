You can iterate over dictionaries using a for loop, just like with strings, lists, and tuples. This will iterate over the sequence of keys in the dictionary. If you want to access the corresponding values associated with the keys, you could use the keys as indexes. Or you can use the items method on the dictionary, like dictionary.items(). This method returns a tuple for each element in the dictionary, where the first element in the tuple is the key and the second is the value.

If you only wanted to access the keys in a dictionary, you could use the keys() method on the dictionary: dictionary.keys(). If you only wanted the values, you could use the values() method: dictionary.values().
